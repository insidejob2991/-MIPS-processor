# -MIPS-processor
Python-based emulator for a custom MIPS processor designed to perform:  Sum of N Natural Numbers Fibonacci Sequence Generation Counting Occurrences of a Number in a List The project simulates MIPS-like architecture with instruction-based logic, registers, and memory handling. Ideal for learning MIPS concepts and experimenting with algorithm
